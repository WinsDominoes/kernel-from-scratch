- 21/4/2021 | This was when the project started! I've decided to create this repo, to document about me creating an operating system. I will probably put this on github sites somewhere, but I hope that you will enjoy me doing all of this mess. Again, this is NOT for production use. This is purely for education purposes aka I just want to learn how an operating system works. I hope to see you on the next day of the project. - Win
