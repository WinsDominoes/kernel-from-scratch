# kernel-from-scratch
This is my project for creating an operating system kernel, from scratch. Not the actual "scratch" but you know the meaning of it. (this is a project once I have a good knowledge of C)

## Info
This will only be a kernel, not an entire operating system with a bootloader. But, JUST the kernel. 
- Mostly written in C

## How?
I will be using this tutorial hahaha http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/

## Roadmap
1. Just make a freaking kernel
